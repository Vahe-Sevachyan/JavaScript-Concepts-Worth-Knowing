## Primitive Data Types

There are 8 Basic Data Types in Javascript

- Number - numbers of any kind: integer or floating point
- String - a string is letters or numbers that are wrapped in quotation marks
- Boolean - "true" or "false" value
- Null - a standalone type that has no value(can be used as a placeholder)
- Undefined - a variable or function returns a type of "undefined" when the data being evaluated has no value
- Object - used for complex data structures
- bigint - used for number storing big integer values that are to big to be represented by a normal JS "number" type
- Symbol - for unique identifiers
